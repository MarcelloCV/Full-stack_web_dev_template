## Early description of the project
### What is it for…
To help web development beginners to start building their project with this template as a handful and versatile foundation rather than having to start all over from scratch. 
### Goal…
- A final template for swift web development with minimal dependencies yet full-fledged, versatile, performant, reliable, and efficient.
> [!TIP] 
> Plain → Utilities → Templating → Building → Deployment → Maintenance
### Measures to success…
- Comprehensive REST APIs to handle HTTP requests from the client
- Session to enable auto-save for user-input data, and to achieve persistent log-in
- Separation of concerns (R.I.P. PHP) between the server side and the client side, as well as a partition for the static site generator which is to be rendered at build time unlike the two
- HTML templating in templates package with block definition and inheritance directives ready to replace the template directives, whose output will be rendered and stored in builds package
- Provides database alternatives to SQL, such as any NoSQL databases and even server-located/internal databases, may it be on cloud or on premise
- Provides basic implementations of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) by parsing and rendering at once on page request, or Static Site Generation (SSG) by parsing at build time which later can be rendered on page request
- Provides basic architecture for both Single-Page App (SPA) and Multi-Page App (MPA)
- Ensure asynchronous DOM manipulation for seamless page and element transition/animation with minimal JavaScript bloating as possible
- Web sockets for live stream using UDP to maintain continuous connection without unnecessary TCP handshaking 
- Provides essential components leveraging Bootstrap CSS styling
- Make a succinct documentation about the template
- Add comments for some insightful cheat-sheets and idioms within the template for hands-on or observative learning
